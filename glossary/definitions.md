# Definitions (Dynamic Field Model)

This document provides detailed definitions for terms used throughout the
Dynamic Field Model (DFM).

---

## Core Structures

### **Dynamic Field Model (DFM)**
A multidimensional framework that models human cognition, behaviour, and
development as patterns within a dynamic cognitive field shaped by four axes,
twelve archetypes, wave dynamics, and seven dimensions of intelligence.

---

### **Cognitive Field**
The overall “space” of possible cognitive states, including perceptions,
thought patterns, emotional responses, and behavioural tendencies at any given
moment.

---

### **Four-Axis Cognitive Model**
The foundational structure of DFM, describing four core tensions in cognition:

- Logic ↔ Value  
- Vision ↔ Reality  
- Innovation ↔ Action  
- Structure ↔ Care  

All other model components derive from these axes.

---

### **Axis / Axes**
A cognitive polarity representing a spectrum between two complementary modes
(e.g., Logic vs Value). Each axis is always present, but one pole may be more
active than the other at a given time.

---

### **Pole**
One end of a cognitive axis (e.g., Logic is a pole on the Logic–Value axis).

---

### **Archetype Wheel**
A circular model consisting of twelve archetypes, each representing a stable
configuration of two axes. The wheel is non-hierarchical and continuous.

---

### **Archetype**
A temporary cognitive–behavioural mode emerging from the interaction of two
axes. Archetypes describe **how** a person is thinking and relating in a
moment, not **who** they are in identity terms.

---

### **Personality Wave Model**
The DFM component describing movement between archetypes on the wheel.  
It models personality as a wave-like process — expanding, contracting, and
shifting modes over time.

---

### **Developmental Dynamics**
The set of processes by which individuals expand their accessible cognitive
field, increase flexibility, stabilize waves, and integrate multiple dimensions
of intelligence.

---

## Seven-Dimensional Intelligence

### **Cognitive Intelligence**
Capacity for reasoning, analysis, structured problem-solving, and understanding
relationships between concepts.

---

### **Emotional Intelligence**
Capacity to perceive, interpret, and regulate emotions in oneself and others.

---

### **Somatic Intelligence**
Capacity for bodily awareness, grounding, and physiological self-regulation.

---

### **Relational Intelligence**
Capacity to navigate interpersonal dynamics, boundaries, group processes, and
social cues.

---

### **Ethical Intelligence**
Capacity to reason about values, principles, responsibility, and consequences.

---

### **Creative Intelligence**
Capacity to generate novelty, synthesize ideas, and reframe situations in
original ways.

---

### **Integrative Intelligence**
Meta-capacity to bring all other dimensions into coherent alignment.  
It coordinates cognition, emotion, action, and meaning into a unified response.

---

## Axis-Related Terms

### **Logic**
Orientation toward structure, consistency, and truth-seeking through
impersonal reasoning.

---

### **Value**
Orientation toward meaning, significance, preference, and personal or shared
importance.

---

### **Vision**
Orientation toward abstraction, possibilities, patterns, and future states.

---

### **Reality**
Orientation toward concrete details, current conditions, and verifiable facts.

---

### **Innovation**
Orientation toward novelty, experimentation, and exploring new approaches.

---

### **Action**
Orientation toward execution, implementation, and creating outcomes.

---

### **Structure**
Orientation toward organization, stability, rules, and systems.

---

### **Care**
Orientation toward relational connection, support, empathy, and well-being.

---

### **Axis Balance**
A state in which both poles of an axis are acknowledged and utilized in a
flexible, context-appropriate way.

---

### **Axis Imbalance**
A state in which one pole dominates excessively (e.g., Logic without Value),
leading to distortions or blind spots.

---

## Wave and State Terms

### **Wave**
A patterned sequence of shifts between archetypes or axis activations over
time. Waves describe the movement of cognition, not identity.

---

### **Coherence Wave**
A wave pattern in which movement is smooth, flexible, and adaptive, with
balanced axis engagement and broad archetype access.

---

### **Stress Wave**
A wave pattern characterized by rigidity, narrowed archetype access, and
heightened emotional or cognitive tension.

---

### **Developmental Wave**
A long-term pattern of movement that reflects maturation, increasing
integration, and expanded access to the cognitive field.

---

### **Expansion**
A state in which an individual has access to more archetypes, broader
perspectives, and greater flexibility.

---

### **Contraction**
A state in which cognitive access narrows, often due to stress, leading to
rigid or repetitive patterns.

---

### **Oscillation**
A repeated back-and-forth movement between a small number of modes or poles,
often under moderate stress or unresolved tension.

---

### **Wave Stabilization**
Process by which waves become smoother, less extreme, and more coherent over
time through development and integration.

---

## Archetypal Modes (by name)

*(Each archetype is defined briefly here; see core-models for deeper detail.)*

### **Seer**
Archetype oriented toward pattern recognition, abstraction, and conceptual
insight (Vision + Logic emphasis).

---

### **Mentor**
Archetype focused on guidance, inspiration, and helping others see potential
(Vision + Value).

---

### **Healer**
Archetype centered on emotional understanding and grounding meaning in lived
experience (Value + Reality).

---

### **Nurturer**
Archetype providing stability, support, and care for others’ well-being (Value
+ Care).

---

### **Advocate**
Archetype that champions fairness, protection, and relational justice (Care +
Value).

---

### **Rebel**
Archetype that challenges norms, disrupts stagnation, and pushes for change
(Action + Vision).

---

### **Creator**
Archetype that generates new ideas, frameworks, and possibilities (Innovation +
Vision).

---

### **Driver**
Archetype that emphasizes efficiency, decisiveness, and direct problem-solving
(Action + Logic).

---

### **Builder**
Archetype focused on implementing plans, organizing resources, and achieving
tangible results (Action + Structure).

---

### **Architect**
Archetype that designs systems, structures, and strategies (Structure +
Innovation).

---

### **Analyst**
Archetype that evaluates, categorizes, and refines information with precision
(Structure + Logic).

---

### **Sage**
Archetype that synthesizes knowledge into principled, long-view understanding
(Logic + Structure).

---

## Development & Application

### **Archetype Expansion**
The process of increasing the number of archetypal modes an individual can
access and use constructively.

---

### **Intelligence Integration**
The process of bringing multiple intelligence dimensions into alignment so they
support each other rather than pull in conflicting directions.

---

### **Contraction Loop**
A recurring pattern in which stress causes repeated cycling between a limited
set of modes or poles, reducing flexibility and coherence.

---

### **Cognitive Flexibility**
The ability to shift cognitive modes, perspectives, and strategies in response
to changing context or new information.

---

### **Coherence**
A state in which thoughts, feelings, values, actions, and context are aligned
enough to allow clear, stable functioning.

---

### **Cognitive Rigidity**
Difficulty shifting perspective or mode, often marked by black-and-white
thinking, repetitive responses, or resistance to new information.

---

## AI & Applications

### **AI Bridge**
The application of DFM principles to AI–human interaction, providing a
non-diagnostic cognitive scaffold for safer, more interpretable responses.

---

### **Communication Dynamics**
The study of how axis activation, archetypes, and wave states shape
communication styles and conversational flow.

---

### **Decision-Making Dynamics**
The use of DFM’s axes and intelligence dimensions to understand how decisions
are formed, distorted, and improved.

---

### **Non-Diagnostic Framework**
A framework that provides structure and insight without assigning clinical
labels, types, traits, or diagnoses to individuals.

---

### **Cognitive Geometry**
The abstract “shape” of cognitive patterns formed by axes, archetypes, and wave
movement within the field.

---

### **Interpretability (AI Context)**
The degree to which an AI system’s responses can be understood in terms of
clear, explainable cognitive structures rather than opaque internal processes.
