# Seven-Dimensional Intelligence Model

The Seven-Dimensional Intelligence Model describes human intelligence as a
multi-layered, interdependent system.  
Each dimension represents a distinct capacity within the broader cognitive
field, and all seven together form a coherent, adaptive intelligence system.

This model moves beyond narrow, trait-based or purely academic definitions of
intelligence. Instead, it captures the **full cognitive ecology** that shapes
how people think, feel, act, relate, and integrate experience.

The dimensions are not “skills” or “types” — they are functional capacities
that develop unevenly across individuals and fluctuate based on context.

# 🧭 Overview of the Seven Dimensions

### **1. Cognitive Intelligence**
The capacity for reasoning, analyzing, problem-solving, and understanding
structure.  
Emerges primarily from the **Logic**, **Structure**, and **Reality** poles of the Four Axes.

Key abilities include:
- pattern recognition  
- critical thinking  
- evaluation and categorization  
- structured problem-solving  
- evidence-based reasoning  

---

### **2. Emotional Intelligence**
The capacity to perceive, interpret, regulate, and use emotions effectively,
both internally and in others.

Linked strongly to the **Value**, **Care**, and **Reality** poles.

Key abilities include:
- emotional awareness  
- self-regulation  
- empathy  
- contextual sensitivity  
- healthy expression and interpretation of affect  

---

### **3. Somatic Intelligence**
The capacity for bodily awareness, sensory grounding, and embodied cognition.  
Often underrepresented in traditional models of intelligence.

This dimension stabilizes the cognitive field by anchoring awareness in the
body and present moment.

Key abilities include:
- interoception (awareness of internal bodily states)  
- proprioception (movement/position awareness)  
- grounding under stress  
- physiological self-regulation  
- intuitive bodily feedback  

---

### **4. Relational Intelligence**
The capacity to understand, navigate, and maintain interpersonal dynamics.  
Draws heavily on **Care**, **Value**, and **Structure**.

Key abilities include:
- reading social cues  
- understanding interpersonal boundaries  
- navigating group dynamics  
- conflict resolution  
- healthy reciprocity in relationships  

---

### **5. Ethical Intelligence**
The capacity to recognize, evaluate, and align with values, principles, and
responsibility.

This dimension integrates **Value**, **Logic**, and **Structure**, forming the
“moral architecture” of cognition.

Key abilities include:
- value discernment  
- responsibility-taking  
- long-term consequence awareness  
- fairness and consistency  
- internal moral coherence  

---

### **6. Creative Intelligence**
The capacity to generate novelty, synthesize concepts, and imagine new
possibilities.

Emerges strongly from **Vision** and **Innovation** poles.

Key abilities include:
- divergent thinking  
- conceptual synthesis  
- flexible perspective-shifting  
- original ideation  
- reimagining constraints  

---

### **7. Integrative Intelligence**
The capacity to bring all other forms of intelligence into coherent alignment.  
This is the **meta-intelligence** that coordinates the entire cognitive field.

It emerges when the system as a whole is:
- balanced  
- self-aware  
- flexible  
- grounded  
- developmentally mature  

Key abilities include:
- seeing patterns across domains  
- unifying emotion, logic, and action  
- self-reflection and metacognition  
- resolving internal contradictions  
- adaptive coherence across contexts

# 🔗 How the Seven Dimensions Relate to the Four Axes

Each dimension draws from the Four Axes in unique ways:

- **Logic, Structure** → Cognitive, Ethical  
- **Value, Care** → Emotional, Relational, Ethical  
- **Vision, Innovation** → Creative  
- **Reality, Action** → Somatic, Relational  
- **All Axes Combined** → Integrative  

These relationships show that intelligence is not one thing — it is a **field
interaction**, shaped by how the axes activate, balance, and reinforce one
another.

# 🔄 Development Across the Seven Dimensions

Intelligence develops unevenly across individuals.  
Some dimensions mature quickly, others later in life.  
Healthy development involves:

- strengthening weak dimensions  
- refining strong dimensions  
- integrating conflicting tendencies  
- increasing flexibility between modes  

The Dynamic Field Model views intelligence not as a fixed score but as an
**evolving system**.

# 🧭 Summary

The Seven-Dimensional Intelligence Model provides a holistic scaffold for
understanding human cognition.  
It clarifies why individuals excel in some areas but struggle in others, why
intelligence changes over time, and how development leads to greater coherence
and adaptability.

It is a foundational component of the Dynamic Field Model and directly informs:
- the Personality Wave Model  
- developmental dynamics  
- communication patterns  
- self-regulation strategies  
- AI-human interface design
