# The Archetype Wheel (12-Phase Cognitive Field Model)

The Archetype Wheel describes twelve distinct cognitive–behavioural configurations generated by the interactions of the Four Axes of cognition.  
Each archetype represents a **stable phase** within the larger dynamic field of human cognition.

The Archetype Wheel is not a personality typing system.  
Instead, it models **how cognition organizes itself in patterned configurations** depending on context, development, and internal state.  
Individuals move fluidly between archetypes across time — a process formalized in the Personality Wave Model.

# 🧭 Overview

Each archetype arises from the interaction of **two poles from two different axes**.  
Because the axes form a 4-dimensional system, there are exactly **12 unique pairings**, producing 12 archetypal modes.

These modes are:

1. Seer  
2. Mentor  
3. Healer  
4. Nurturer  
5. Advocate  
6. Rebel  
7. Creator  
8. Driver  
9. Builder  
10. Architect  
11. Analyst  
12. Sage  

Each one reflects a coherent cognitive pattern with predictable strengths, stress responses, and developmental tendencies.

This diagram expresses:

- rotational symmetry  
- equal weighting of all archetypes  
- a balance of cognitive forces  
- no hierarchy  
- seamless transitions between modes

# 📐 Why 12 Archetypes?

Because:

- there are **4 cognitive axes**,  
- each with **2 poles**,  
- and archetypes emerge from the **pairing of two poles from separate axes**,  
- the system necessarily produces **12 unique combinations**.

This 12-phase model captures:

- diversity of cognitive patterns  
- dynamic movement between configurations  
- predictable developmental sequences  
- stable and unstable configurations under stress  

The system is **structural**, not cultural.  
It does not depend on typology traditions, personality categories, or value systems.

# 🔄 Relationship to the Personality Wave Model

The Archetype Wheel is **static** — it shows the positions.

The Personality Wave Model is **dynamic** — it shows how individuals:

- shift between archetypes  
- expand and contract in cognitive flexibility  
- navigate stress vs coherence states  
- follow predictable paths of development  

Together, they form the core of the Dynamic Field Model.

# 🧭 Summary

The Archetype Wheel provides:

- a clear map of 12 cognitive configurations  
- a non-hierarchical, non-typological structure  
- a foundation for understanding cognitive dynamics  
- the positional logic needed for wave-based movement  
- a bridge between axes, intelligence, and behavioural patterns  

It is a structural model of **how cognition organizes itself** within a dynamic field.
