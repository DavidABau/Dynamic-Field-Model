# Four-Axis Cognitive Model
The Four-Axis Cognitive Model is the foundation of the Dynamic Field Model.  
It describes the underlying structure of human cognition as the interaction of four fundamental cognitive tensions, each representing a polarity of attention, motivation, and information processing.

These axes are not personality traits.  
They are **universal cognitive coordinates** that shape how human beings perceive, interpret, and engage with the world.

The interplay of these four axes generates the full range of cognitive patterns, including the 12 Archetypes and the Personality Wave Model.

## 🧭 Overview of the Four Axes

Each axis represents a fundamental tension or mode of cognition.  
The axes always operate together, but individuals and situations may highlight one side more than the other.

### **1. Logic ↔ Value**
**Logic** — prioritizing what is structurally true, consistent, or useful  
**Value** — prioritizing what is meaningful, important, or personally relevant  

This axis represents the core tension between:
- objective reasoning  
- subjective meaning-making  

It governs how people evaluate information, make judgments, and anchor decisions.

---

### **2. Vision ↔ Reality**
**Vision** — oriented toward possibility, abstraction, patterns, and future states  
**Reality** — oriented toward concrete details, present conditions, and what can be verified  

This axis describes the tension between:
- divergent thinking (what *could* be)  
- convergent thinking (what *is*)  

It governs imagination, perception, forecasting, and practical stability.

---

### **3. Innovation ↔ Action**
**Innovation** — generating new approaches, exploring options, seeking novelty  
**Action** — executing decisions, applying force, creating outcomes  

This axis captures the tension between:
- ideation  
- implementation  

It shapes creativity, problem-solving approaches, adaptability, and momentum.

---

### **4. Structure ↔ Care**
**Structure** — organizing, stabilizing, maintaining systems, creating order  
**Care** — attending to human needs, relationships, well-being, and emotional context  

This axis represents the tension between:
- systemic coherence  
- interpersonal coherence  

It governs nurturing, responsibility, organization, and support.

## 📐 How the Axes Interact

The axes are **orthogonal**: each operates independently, yet they intersect to form a multidimensional cognitive field.

Their interactions generate:
- the 12 Archetypes  
- characteristic patterns of behaviour  
- developmental pathways  
- stress and coherence patterns  
- intelligence dynamics across the 7-Dimensional Model  

Because the axes combine two at a time, each archetype is formed at the **intersection** of two cognitive polarities.  
For example:
- Vision + Logic = *pattern-seeking analytical insight*  
- Structure + Care = *supportive relational organization*  

This combinatory structure is the basis for the Archetype Wheel.

## 🔄 Axis Dynamics: Tension and Balance

At any moment, cognition is shaped by:
- which side of each axis is activated  
- how strongly each pole is expressed  
- how balanced or imbalanced the system is  

High coherence occurs when:
- the poles are in dynamic equilibrium  
- the individual can shift flexibly based on context  
- no single axis dominates at the expense of others  

Low coherence occurs when:
- one pole becomes rigid  
- the opposing pole is suppressed  
- transitions between poles become difficult  

Understanding axis dynamics helps predict:
- behavioural tendencies  
- communication patterns  
- stress responses  
- growth pathways

## 🧠 Why the Four Axes Matter

The Four-Axis Model provides a foundation for:

### **1. The 12 Archetypes**
Each archetype represents a stable configuration of two axes.

### **2. The Personality Wave Model**
Describes movement between configurations as a function of context and internal state.

### **3. The 7-Dimensional Model of Intelligence**
Each dimension of intelligence draws on different axes in unique ways.

### **4. Communication, leadership, and decision-making**
Axes reveal *how* people process information, not *what type* they are.

### **5. AI cognitive mapping**
The axes can be used as structural scaffolding for modelling human-to-AI interpretability.

## 🔍 Summary

The Four-Axis Cognitive Model describes the fundamental cognitive polarities that govern:
- perception  
- decision-making  
- creativity  
- behaviour  
- emotional dynamics  
- interpersonal interactions  

These axes provide the structural logic from which the entire Dynamic Field Model arises.
