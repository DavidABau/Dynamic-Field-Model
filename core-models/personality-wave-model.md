# Personality Wave Model
The Personality Wave Model describes how individuals move dynamically between
the 12 archetypes of the Archetype Wheel.  
Unlike traditional personality systems that assume stable categories or fixed
traits, this model views personality as a **fluid, adaptive, wave-like process**
within a structured cognitive field.

Human cognition shifts in predictable patterns depending on:
- context  
- internal state  
- stress and regulation  
- developmental stage  
- environmental demands  

These shifts form coherent “waves” that travel across the Archetype Wheel.

# 🧭 Core Principles

### **1. Personality is dynamic, not static**
People do not remain in one archetype. They move fluidly across modes as they:
- think  
- adapt  
- regulate emotion  
- solve problems  
- respond to challenges  

This movement is structured and predictable.

---

### **2. The wheel forms a continuous field**
The 12 archetypes are not separate boxes.  
They are positions within a continuous cognitive topology.

Movement from one archetype to another is not random — it follows the geometry
of the Archetype Wheel and the tensions of the Four Axes.

---

### **3. Movement follows wave patterns**
A “wave” is a patterned sequence of shifts across the wheel.  
Waves occur when cognition reorganizes itself to:

- respond to stress  
- return to equilibrium  
- incorporate new information  
- grow or expand  
- complete problem-solving cycles  

A wave may be small (shifting only one or two positions) or large (traversing
multiple sectors of the wheel).

# 🔄 Types of Waves

### **1. Coherence Waves**
These occur when the individual is balanced, regulated, and flexible.

Characteristics:
- smooth transitions  
- integration of multiple perspectives  
- stable emotional patterns  
- ability to use the strengths of adjacent archetypes  
- increased clarity and adaptability  

Coherent waves often expand outward, exploring more of the wheel.

---

### **2. Stress Waves**
Under stress, movement tends to become more rigid and narrow.

Characteristics:
- oscillation between two or three positions  
- reduced flexibility  
- fixation on familiar cognitive patterns  
- difficulty integrating conflicting information  
- emotional reactivity  

Stress waves typically contract inward.

---

### **3. Developmental Waves**
Long-term waves that unfold over months or years.

Characteristics:
- shifts driven by maturation  
- broadening of accessible archetypes  
- increased intelligence integration  
- more stable access to high-complexity modes  

Developmental waves reflect the natural growth of the cognitive system.

# 🔁 Wave Geometry

Movement on the wheel follows two main geometric patterns:

### **1. Adjacent Shifts**
Movement to the next archetype clockwise or counterclockwise.

These represent natural, low-friction transitions — such as moving from:
- Seer → Mentor  
- Advocate → Nurturer  
- Driver → Builder  

These shifts happen frequently in everyday cognition.

---

### **2. Axis Crossings**
Movement across the center or across opposing poles of a major axis.

Examples:
- Vision → Reality  
- Logic → Value  
- Innovation → Structure  

Axis crossings represent deeper cognitive reorientation and often appear:
- during significant learning  
- in conflict resolution  
- in emotional insight  
- during creativity or problem-solving  
- in developmental transitions  

These are higher-energy transitions.

# 🧬 How Waves Relate to the Four Axes

Each axis introduces a tension that shapes wave movement:

- **Logic ↔ Value**  
  Waves oscillate between analytical detachment and personal meaning.

- **Vision ↔ Reality**  
  Waves shift between possibilities and concrete conditions.

- **Innovation ↔ Action**  
  Waves alternate between ideation and execution.

- **Structure ↔ Care**  
  Waves balance system coherence with human coherence.

Waves form when the mind rebalances these tensions in real time.

---

# 📉 Contraction and Expansion

Wave movement includes two fundamental states:

### **Contraction**
- Narrow focus  
- Heightened stress  
- Reduced flexibility  
- Rigid cycling between familiar modes  

### **Expansion**
- Broader access to archetypes  
- Increased creativity  
- Emotional stability  
- Higher integrative intelligence  

The ability to transition from contraction to expansion is a marker of cognitive
health and adaptability.

# 🧭 Practical Applications

The Personality Wave Model supports:

### **Self-awareness**
Understanding one’s current position on the wheel and how it shifts.

### **Communication**
Predicting how others may shift under pressure or in response to new
information.

### **Problem-solving**
Mapping wave trajectories to identify blind spots and needed perspectives.

### **Development**
Designing strategies that increase flexibility, resilience, and coherence.

### **AI alignment frameworks**
Providing interpretable, non-clinical cognitive dynamics that an AI system can
track or model without typing or diagnosing users.

# 🧩 Summary

The Personality Wave Model provides a dynamic understanding of cognition as a
wave-like movement through structured archetypal configurations.

It clarifies:
- why people behave differently in different contexts  
- how stress and coherence shape cognition  
- how development expands access to the full wheel  
- how intelligence integrates across domains  

Together with the Four Axes and the Archetype Wheel, the Personality Wave Model
forms a central pillar of the Dynamic Field Model.
