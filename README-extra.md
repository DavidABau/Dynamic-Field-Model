# Dynamic Field Model (DFM)

The Dynamic Field Model (DFM) is a non-diagnostic, non-typological framework
for understanding human cognition as a dynamic field of shifting patterns.

Instead of assigning fixed personality types, DFM models:

- **Four core cognitive axes**
- **Twelve archetypal configurations**
- **Wave dynamics** of expansion, contraction, and integration
- **Seven dimensions of intelligence**
- **Stress and recovery patterns**
- **Applications to AI–human interaction and decision-making**

DFM is intended as an educational and conceptual tool, not a clinical or
diagnostic system.

Quick Start
If you’re new to the Dynamic Field Model, start here:

Four-Axis Cognitive Model
→ core-models/4-axis-model.md

Archetype Wheel
→ core-models/archetype-wheel.md

Personality Wave Model
→ core-models/personality-wave-model.md

Seven-Dimensional Intelligence
→ core-models/seven-dimensional-intelligence.md

Field Overview (Axes + Wheel)
→ core-models/developmental-dynamics.md

For terminology, see:

glossary/terms.md

glossary/definitions.md

Core Models
Four Axes
core-models/4-axis-model.md
Defines the four core tensions:
Logic–Value, Vision–Reality, Innovation–Action, Structure–Care.

Archetype Wheel
core-models/archetype-wheel.md
Describes the twelve archetypal configurations that emerge from the axes.

Personality Wave Model
core-models/personality-wave-model.md
Explains how cognition moves between archetypes over time as waves.

Seven-Dimensional Intelligence
core-models/seven-dimensional-intelligence.md
Describes Cognitive, Emotional, Somatic, Relational, Ethical, Creative, and
Integrative Intelligence.

Developmental Dynamics
core-models/developmental-dynamics.md
Covers expansion, contraction, integration, and long-term developmental
patterns.

Applications
Practical uses of the model in non-clinical, non-diagnostic ways.

AI & Cognition
AI Bridge
→ applications/ai-bridge.md
Explains AI as a non-biological, adaptive carrier substrate that amplifies
human cognitive signals without originating its own intrinsic signal.
Frames AI as a tool, not a social agent.

AI as Field Amplifier
→ applications/ai-as-field-amplifier.md
Describes AI as a steady-state amplifier in the cognitive field, mapping
amplification behaviour onto wave dynamics and the seven dimensions of
intelligence.

Communication & Decision-Making
Communication Dynamics
→ applications/communication-dynamics.md

Decision-Making Dynamics
→ applications/decision-making-dynamics.md

Self-Development Guide
→ applications/self-development-guide.md

Stress & Wave Behaviour
Stress and Trauma (DFM Perspective)
→ applications/stress-and-trauma.md
Provides a structural, DFM-only explanation of stress as signal overload and
trauma as frozen defensive harmonics. Non-clinical, non-diagnostic.

Stress Patterns by Archetype
→ applications/archetype-stress-patterns.md
Contains tables showing how each archetype distorts under stress and how
relief patterns support return to coherence.


Typology Bridges
DFM is not a typing system, but it can be compared to existing personality
frameworks for orientation.

MBTI Bridge
→ typology-bridges/mbti-bridge.md

Enneagram Bridge
→ typology-bridges/enneagram-bridge.md

Big Five Bridge
→ typology-bridges/bigfive-bridge.md

Temperament Bridge
→ typology-bridges/temperament-bridge.md

DFM vs Typology Systems
→ typology-bridges/hns-vs-typology.md
Clarifies that DFM models dynamic cognitive states, not fixed personality
types, and is non-diagnostic and non-symbolic.

Glossary
Glossary Terms

Glossary Definitions
→ glossary/definitions.md

Use these to clarify unfamiliar terms (axes, archetypes, waves, intelligence
dimensions, etc.).

FAQ and Common Misconceptions
You may optionally keep these as separate files, or include them here.

FAQ
→ FAQ.md (or section in this file)
Addresses questions like:

“Is this based on the zodiac or the twelve tribes?”

“Is this a personality typing system?”

“Is this a spiritual or metaphysical model?”

Common Misconceptions
→ COMMON-MISCONCEPTIONS.md (or section in this file)
Clarifies that DFM:

is not astrology or numerology

does not type or diagnose people

does not prescribe behaviour

uses “field” in a conceptual, not metaphysical, sense

Roadmap
See:

ROADMAP.md — versioning and future plans

TODO.md — granular tasks (diagrams, docs, tooling)

Contributing
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

CONTRIBUTING.md

At this stage, contributions are best focused on:

improving explanations and examples

suggesting clarifying diagrams

catching ambiguity or language that could be misinterpreted as diagnostic,
typological, or metaphysical.
