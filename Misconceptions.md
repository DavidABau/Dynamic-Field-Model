📄 Misconceptions

The Dynamic Field Model (DFM) is often compared to other systems or traditions due to superficial similarities in language or structure.
This section clarifies what DFM is not, to prevent confusion or misinterpretation.
❌ “Is DFM based on astrology, zodiac signs, or symbolic systems?”

No.
The model’s twelve archetypes arise from the mathematical interaction of four cognitive axes in a circular topology.
Many human traditions also use 12-part structures because 12 divides cycles and circles cleanly.
The resemblance is coincidental.

DFM contains no symbolic assignments, no planetary associations, and no esoteric mappings.
❌ “Is DFM a spiritual or metaphysical system?”

No.
DFM is a structural cognitive model.
It describes how thinking patterns shift, stabilize, and interact.
It does not make claims about the nature of consciousness, spiritual states, or universal metaphysics.

Any deeper philosophical explorations remain outside the scope of the public framework.
❌ “Does DFM describe personality types or classify people?”

No.
Unlike typologies (e.g., MBTI, Enneagram, Big Five), DFM does not assign categories, predict behaviours, or identify identity-based traits.

DFM describes:

    cognitive modes
    axis activation patterns
    wave dynamics
    moment-to-moment shifts

It is non-diagnostic and non-evaluative.
❌ “Can DFM be used to diagnose psychological conditions?”

Absolutely not.
DFM is not a clinical tool.
It does not describe disorders, pathology, symptoms, or mental health conditions.
It should never be used as a psychological assessment.
❌ “Does DFM tell people who they are?”

No.
DFM avoids identity labels entirely.

It supports:

    cognitive clarity
    flexible self-understanding
    developmental insight
    healthier communication

DFM describes process, not identity.
❌ “Is DFM meant to replace other personality systems?”

No.
DFM is complementary, not substitutive.

Typology systems describe long-term tendencies.
DFM describes real-time cognitive movement.

Both can coexist without conflict.
❌ “Is there an approved way to read or ‘use’ the archetypes?”

No.
Archetypes in DFM do not assign fixed roles or hidden meanings.
They describe temporary configurations of cognitive axes.

There is no correct or incorrect archetype to “be.”
❌ “Does the model imply moral ranking or ‘higher’ vs ‘lower’ states?”

No.
DFM is non-hierarchical.
All axes and archetypes serve important roles depending on context.

The model avoids:

    value judgments
    superiority/inferiority narratives
    prescriptive behaviour standards

It is descriptive and educational only.
❌ “Does the model imply the existence of a universal field of consciousness?”

No.
DFM uses the term “field” as a metaphor for the space of cognitive possibilities.
It is not a metaphysical claim and does not imply physical or mystical fields.
❌ “Can this model be used to determine compatibility between people?”

No.
DFM is not a relational typing system and does not produce compatibility profiles.

It can help people understand communication patterns, but not predict relationships.
