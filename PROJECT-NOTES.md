## Development Note

This project was developed through human-led design and synthesis, with the
assistance of AI tools used for drafting, clarification, and structural
exploration.

All conceptual framing, scope decisions, ethical boundaries, and final content
curation were determined by the project author. AI is used here as a supportive
tool, not as an originating source of ideas or authority.
