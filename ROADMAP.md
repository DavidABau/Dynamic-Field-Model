# Dynamic Field Model — Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the current state, completed milestones, and planned
future development of the Dynamic Field Model (DFM) repository.

DFM is intentionally developed at a measured pace to maintain clarity,
coherence, and ethical integrity. This roadmap reflects that philosophy.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 — Core Model Foundation (COMPLETED)

Status: **Complete**

This phase established the conceptual backbone of the Dynamic Field Model.

### Core Concepts
- [x] Four-Axis Cognitive Model
  - Logic ↔ Value
  - Vision ↔ Reality
  - Innovation ↔ Action
  - Structure ↔ Care

- [x] Archetype Wheel (12 archetypal configurations)
- [x] Personality Wave Model (dynamic movement, not typing)
- [x] Seven-Dimensional Intelligence Model
  - Cognitive
  - Emotional
  - Somatic
  - Relational
  - Ethical
  - Creative
  - Integrative

### Documentation
- [x] Core model markdown files
- [x] Non-diagnostic framing throughout
- [x] Clear separation from typology and astrology
- [x] Internal consistency across documents

---

## ✅ Phase 2 — Visual Architecture (COMPLETED)

Status: **Complete**

This phase focused on making the model visually legible and accessible.

### Diagrams (SVG)
- [x] Four Axes diagram
- [x] Archetype Wheel diagram
- [x] Personality Wave diagram
- [x] Seven-Dimensional Intelligence diagram
- [x] Full Field Map (Axes + Archetype Wheel)
- [x] Archetype Stress & Relief Trajectories map

### Goals Achieved
- Clean SVG rendering across browsers
- Diagrams embedded in documentation
- Visuals aligned precisely with written model
- Repo now usable without deep prior reading

---

## ✅ Phase 3 — Applied Models (COMPLETED)

Status: **Complete**

This phase translated DFM into practical, real-world contexts.

### AI Applications
- [x] AI Bridge
  - AI as adaptive, non-biological carrier substrate
  - AI does not originate signal
  - AI amplifies coherence or incoherence

- [x] AI as Field Amplifier
  - Steady-state amplification
  - Wave interaction
  - 7D intelligence alignment
  - Ethical framing

### Human Applications
- [x] Stress & Trauma (DFM-only explanation)
  - Stress as signal overload
  - Trauma as frozen defensive harmonics
  - Non-clinical, non-diagnostic language

- [x] Stress Patterns by Archetype
- [x] Relief Patterns by Archetype
- [x] Stress & Relief Trajectory Diagram

---

## ✅ Phase 4 — Typology Bridges (COMPLETED)

Status: **Complete**

This phase provided orientation for readers familiar with existing systems,
without turning DFM into a typing framework.

- [x] MBTI Bridge
- [x] Enneagram Bridge
- [x] Big Five Bridge
- [x] Temperament Bridge
- [x] DFM vs Typology Comparison

Clarifies:
- DFM models states, not identities
- No fixed types
- No diagnostic intent

---

## 🟡 Phase 5 — Refinement & Clarity (IN PROGRESS)

Status: **Ongoing**

This phase focuses on polish, clarity, and reader experience.

### Documentation Improvements
- [ ] Final pass for language consistency
- [ ] Reduce ambiguity in metaphors
- [ ] Strengthen non-mystical framing where needed
- [ ] Add short intros to key documents

### Navigation & UX
- [ ] Finalise README structure
- [ ] Optional `docs/INDEX.md` for navigation
- [ ] Ensure all diagrams are referenced correctly

### FAQ & Misconceptions
- [ ] Finalise FAQ
- [ ] Common misconceptions page
  - Astrology / zodiac confusion
  - Spiritual or metaphysical misreadings
  - Personality typing assumptions
  - Therapeutic or clinical misuse

---

## 🔵 Phase 6 — Public Readability & Onboarding (PLANNED)

Status: **Planned (No fixed timeline)**

This phase is optional and will only proceed if it improves clarity without
compromising coherence.

Potential items:
- [ ] Quickstart Guide (5–10 minute read)
- [ ] Diagram-first overview page
- [ ] Plain-language summary for non-technical readers
- [ ] Optional PDF export for offline reading

---

## 🔒 Explicit Non-Goals

To preserve clarity and prevent misuse, DFM will **not**:

- Diagnose mental health conditions
- Replace therapy or clinical frameworks
- Assign fixed personality types
- Make metaphysical or spiritual claims
- Predict behaviour or outcomes
- Provide prescriptive life advice

---

## Versioning Philosophy

- Versions reflect **conceptual stability**, not feature count
- Major versions change only when the core model changes
- Minor versions reflect documentation and clarity improvements

---

## Current Focus

The current focus is **stability, clarity, and restraint**.

The model is already structurally complete.  
Future work is about making it *understandable*, not making it bigger.
