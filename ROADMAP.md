# Dynamic Field Model — Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the ongoing development priorities for the Dynamic Field
Model (DFM). It includes near-term tasks, long-term enhancements, and
non-public research areas that will remain separate from the public framework.

---

## 1. Versioning Plan

### **v1.0 — Public Foundation (Current Focus)**
- Core Models
  - Four Axes
  - Archetype Wheel
  - Personality Wave Model
  - Seven-Dimensional Intelligence
  - Developmental Dynamics
- Applications
  - AI Bridge
  - Communication Dynamics
  - Decision-Making
  - Self-Development Guide
- Typology Bridges (MBTI, Enneagram, Big Five, Temperament, Comparison Page)
- Glossary
- Diagrams (PNG/SVG)
- Licensing & Repo Structure

**Goal:**  
A complete, accessible, safe, non-diagnostic public framework.

---

## 2. v1.1 — Diagram & Visualization Expansion

- Add SVG versions of all diagrams  
- Add Archetype Wheel (SVG + PNG)  
- Full Field Map:
  - All four axes
  - Archetype wheel
  - Wave movement overlays  
- Developmental Stage diagram (contraction → expansion → integration)  
- Intelligence Integration map  

**Deliverables:** `/diagrams/svg/` folder + embedded diagrams in core docs.

---

## 3. v1.2 — Documentation Enhancements

- README visual polish  
- Architecture overview diagram  
- Add examples throughout docs:
  - Communication scenarios
  - Decision-making scenarios
  - Axis-balancing case studies (non-clinical)
- Add a “Model FAQ” section:
  - What DFM is
  - What DFM is not  
  - Why DFM avoids typing  
  - How to use the model safely  

---

## 4. v1.3 — Tools & Developer Support

- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`  
- Add Code of Conduct  
- Add Issue Templates  
- Add Pull Request Template  
- Add `docs/` folder for GitHub Pages version  
- Possibly implement Mermaid.js diagrams  
- Add interactive field visualizer (future optional)  

---

## 5. v1.4 — Public-Friendly Summary Layer

- Create simplified diagrams
- Create “DFM For Everyone” outreach document
- Add “Quickstart Guide to Understanding DFM”
- Add “Practical Applications Cheat Sheet”
- Add one-page printable model summary  

---

## 6. v2.0+ — Advanced Non-Public Research Layer (Private)

These topics are intentionally **not** part of the public repository.
They represent deeper theoretical work that will remain private for now.

(See list below under “Non-Public Topics.”)

---

## 7. Long-Term Aspirations

- Provide optional API-style model specification for AI research teams  
- Collaborate with cognitive-science researchers (only if appropriate)  
- Build a reference “DFM Atlas” (like a cognitive periodic table)  
- Explore open educational resources based on the public model
