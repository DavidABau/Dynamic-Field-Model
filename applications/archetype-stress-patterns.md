# Stress Patterns by Archetype  
(DFM — Non-Clinical, Temporary Field States)

This table summarizes how each archetype tends to distort under stress when the
field contracts, wave flexibility decreases, and axis balance is lost.  
These are not personality traits — only **temporary configurations** of the
field.

| Archetype | Primary Distortion Under Stress | Axis Imbalance | Typical Behaviours / Signs |
|----------|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Seer** | Overexpansion into ungrounded possibilities | Vision >> Reality | Catastrophic imagining, overwhelm by future scenarios |
| **Mentor** | Excess responsibility for others | Care >> Structure | Over-advising, difficulty allowing others autonomy |
| **Healer** | Emotional absorption | Value >> Logic | Taking on others' emotions, loss of self-boundaries |
| **Nurturer** | Overextension and depletion | Care >> Action | Trying to stabilise everyone, exhaustion, resentment |
| **Advocate** | Escalation and moral urgency | Value >> Reality | Black-and-white thinking, confrontational righteousness |
| **Rebel** | Reactive opposition | Innovation >> Structure | Pushing back impulsively, resisting constraints, volatility |
| **Creator** | Chaotic expansion | Innovation >> Reality | Too many ideas, fragmentation, inability to complete tasks |
| **Driver** | Forceful action | Action >> Care | Pushing outcomes aggressively, impatience, short temper |
| **Builder** | Overworking and rigidity | Structure >> Vision | Tunnel-vision, perfectionism, difficulty adapting |
| **Architect** | Control tightening | Structure >> Innovation | Micromanagement, inflexibility, shutting down novelty |
| **Analyst** | Paralysis through overthinking | Logic >> Value | Rumination, analysis loops, detachment from feeling |
| **Sage** | Detachment from lived reality | Vision >> Action | Over-abstraction, withdrawal, loss of practical grounding |

# Notes

### • These distortions are **state-based**, not identity-based.  
A person is not “a stressed Seer.”  
The field temporarily moves into the Seer-zone under contraction.

### • Distortions reverse naturally as the wave re-expands.  
When the field stabilises:
- Vision pairs with Reality  
- Value pairs with Logic  
- Innovation rebalances with Structure  
- Action synchronises with Care  

### • Stress does not create new archetypes — it **narrows** access.  
Only a subset of modes remain available until the wave completes.

If you'd like, I can also create:

- **A companion diagram** showing the 12 archetypes in stress trajectories  
- **A “relief patterns” table** showing what *reduces* stress for each archetype  
- **A version of this table optimised for README or Quickstart**  
- **A PDF-ready formatted version**

Just say the word.
