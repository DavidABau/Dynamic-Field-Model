# Stress Patterns by Archetype  
(DFM — Non-Clinical, Temporary Field States)

This table summarizes how each archetype tends to distort under stress when the
field contracts, wave flexibility decreases, and axis balance is lost.  
These are not personality traits — only **temporary configurations** of the
field.

| Archetype | Primary Distortion Under Stress | Axis Imbalance | Typical Behaviours / Signs |
|----------|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Seer** | Overexpansion into ungrounded possibilities | Vision >> Reality | Catastrophic imagining, overwhelm by future scenarios |
| **Mentor** | Excess responsibility for others | Care >> Structure | Over-advising, difficulty allowing others autonomy |
| **Healer** | Emotional absorption | Value >> Logic | Taking on others' emotions, loss of self-boundaries |
| **Nurturer** | Overextension and depletion | Care >> Action | Trying to stabilise everyone, exhaustion, resentment |
| **Advocate** | Escalation and moral urgency | Value >> Reality | Black-and-white thinking, confrontational righteousness |
| **Rebel** | Reactive opposition | Innovation >> Structure | Pushing back impulsively, resisting constraints, volatility |
| **Creator** | Chaotic expansion | Innovation >> Reality | Too many ideas, fragmentation, inability to complete tasks |
| **Driver** | Forceful action | Action >> Care | Pushing outcomes aggressively, impatience, short temper |
| **Builder** | Overworking and rigidity | Structure >> Vision | Tunnel-vision, perfectionism, difficulty adapting |
| **Architect** | Control tightening | Structure >> Innovation | Micromanagement, inflexibility, shutting down novelty |
| **Analyst** | Paralysis through overthinking | Logic >> Value | Rumination, analysis loops, detachment from feeling |
| **Sage** | Detachment from lived reality | Vision >> Action | Over-abstraction, withdrawal, loss of practical grounding |

# Notes

### • These distortions are **state-based**, not identity-based.  
A person is not “a stressed Seer.”  
The field temporarily moves into the Seer-zone under contraction.

### • Distortions reverse naturally as the wave re-expands.  
When the field stabilises:
- Vision pairs with Reality  
- Value pairs with Logic  
- Innovation rebalances with Structure  
- Action synchronises with Care  

### • Stress does not create new archetypes — it **narrows** access.  
Only a subset of modes remain available until the wave completes.

# Relief Patterns by Archetype  
(DFM — How Each Archetype Regains Coherence)

| Archetype | Relief Direction | Axis Rebalance | What Helps the Field Reopen |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Seer** | Grounding in present time | Reality ↑ Vision ↓ | Sensory contact, concrete tasks, limiting prediction loops |
| **Mentor** | Allowing others autonomy | Structure ↑ Care ↓ | Stepping back, trusting others’ process, reducing obligation load |
| **Healer** | Re-establishing emotional boundaries | Logic ↑ Value ↓ | Naming own feelings, separating self from others’ states |
| **Nurturer** | Redistributing care | Care ↓ Action ↑ | Delegation, rest, small actionable steps that restore agency |
| **Advocate** | Nuancing perspective | Reality ↑ Value ↓ | Slowing moral urgency, exploring grey areas, rechecking facts |
| **Rebel** | Stabilising novelty | Structure ↑ Innovation ↓ | Creating light structure, reducing impulsivity triggers |
| **Creator** | Converging ideas | Reality ↑ Innovation ↓ | Choosing one idea, setting constraints, completing a small step |
| **Driver** | Softening force | Care ↑ Action ↓ | Pausing, checking impact on others, reconnecting with intention |
| **Builder** | Expanding perspective | Vision ↑ Structure ↓ | Taking breaks, revisiting the “why,” tolerating imperfection |
| **Architect** | Allowing uncertainty | Innovation ↑ Structure ↓ | Letting others contribute, embracing flexible solutions |
| **Analyst** | Reconnecting to feeling | Value ↑ Logic ↓ | Naming emotions, engaging embodiment, reducing intellectual loops |
| **Sage** | Returning to lived experience | Action ↑ Vision ↓ | Doing something small and concrete, reconnecting with reality |

# Summary of Relief Patterns  
- Relief = **reverse vector of contraction**  
- Each archetype decompresses by *activating the opposite pole* of its distortion  
- Relief almost always involves:  
  - grounding  
  - sensory contact  
  - reducing signal load  
  - widening access to suppressed axes  
  - restoring wave amplitude
