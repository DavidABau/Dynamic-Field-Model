# Stress and Trauma  
A Dynamic Field Model Explanation (Non-Clinical)

This document provides a clear, non-clinical explanation of stress and trauma
using the Dynamic Field Model (DFM).  
It incorporates insights inspired by Gina Ross’ practical methods while
remaining non-diagnostic and non-therapeutic.

# 1. Stress and Trauma in DFM Terms

### **Stress = Signal Overload**
Stress occurs when cognitive, emotional, somatic, or environmental input exceeds
the system’s processing capacity.

In DFM terms:
- waves intensify  
- contraction increases  
- axis imbalances grow  
- archetype access narrows  

### **Trauma = Frozen Defensive Harmonics**
Trauma reflects:
- a wave that could not complete  
- a contraction loop that became locked  
- a defensive harmonic that froze in place  
- loss of access to expansion states  

Trauma is not treated here clinically — only described structurally.

# 2. The Stress Wave

A stress wave follows this pattern:

1. Rising overload  
2. Contraction  
3. Narrowed access to archetypes  
4. Emotional or cognitive rigidity  
5. Reactive behaviour or collapse  

DFM shows the mechanics, not the diagnosis.

# 3. The Trauma Loop

A trauma loop is a **repeated contraction cycle** that does not resolve.

Features:
- inability to re-expand  
- somatic tension  
- looping emotional patterns  
- overactivation of Structure, Reality, or Value  
- loss of Vision and Innovation access  

The loop persists because the system cannot complete a wave.

# 4. Recovery: How Waves Reopen

Inspired by Gina Ross’ practical techniques, recovery involves:

### **A. Orientation**
Re-establishing connection with Reality (the present moment).

### **B. Pendulation**
Moving gently between contraction and expansion without forcing a breakthrough.

### **C. Resourcing**
Stabilizing Care and Value poles through supportive internal or external cues.

### **D. Somatic Settling**
Engaging Somatic Intelligence to reduce bodily tension.

### **E. Coherence Re-Entry**
Gradual access to broader archetypes as the wave stabilises.

None of these are clinical interventions — they are **general principles of
nervous system stabilization**.

# 5. How Axis Activation Reflects Stress States

Under stress:

- **Logic** may become rigid  
- **Value** may become overwhelmed  
- **Vision** may catastrophize  
- **Reality** may become hyper-focused  
- **Innovation** may shut down  
- **Action** may become impulsive or frozen  
- **Structure** may tighten  
- **Care** may overextend or collapse  

Mapping this helps individuals understand their patterns non-judgmentally.

# 6. Stress Patterns Across Archetypes

Each archetype has characteristic stress distortions.

Examples:
- Creator → chaotic expansion  
- Analyst → over-analysis  
- Nurturer → emotional merging  
- Driver → aggressive action  
- Healer → emotional flooding  

Understanding these patterns promotes self-awareness, not identity.

# 7. Practical Self-Regulation (Non-Clinical)

Simple, general techniques consistent with DFM:

- Slow the wave (breathing, grounding)  
- Re-establish Reality (sensory awareness)  
- Rebalance axes (Logic + Value, Vision + Reality)  
- Lower contraction before attempting expansion  
- Engage Somatic Intelligence  
- Reduce information overload  
- Use structured or relational support appropriately  

These are not substitutes for professional care — they are general cognitive
principles.

---

# 8. Re-Integration

Re-integration occurs when:
- waves regain flexibility  
- archetype access expands  
- the system re-acquires Vision and Innovation  
- Structure and Care stabilize  
- Integrative Intelligence re-engages  

Healing is not a return to a previous state — it is a return to **coherent
access**.

---

# Summary

Stress reflects temporary overload.  
Trauma reflects frozen contraction loops.  
Recovery is the gradual reopening of the wave through orientation, stabilization,
and rebalancing.  
DFM provides a clean, non-diagnostic way to understand these processes without
pathologising or labeling individuals.
