# Temperament Bridge  
The Temperament Bridge provides a conceptual translation between the classical
four temperaments — Sanguine, Choleric, Melancholic, and Phlegmatic — and the
Dynamic Field Model (DFM).

This document does not classify or type individuals.  
It explains how temperament tendencies historically described in psychology
can be reinterpreted as **cognitive-field biases**, **axis activations**, and
**wave dynamics** within DFM.

The goal is to provide orientation for users familiar with temperament theory.

# 🧭 The Four Classical Temperaments

Historically, temperaments described broad behavioural styles:

- **Sanguine** → energetic, social, expressive  
- **Choleric** → driven, assertive, goal-oriented  
- **Melancholic** → reflective, detailed, structured  
- **Phlegmatic** → calm, steady, harmonizing  

In DFM terms, these are not identities, but **clusters of axis tendencies**
expressed in certain contexts.

# 🔍 Temperaments Through the Lens of the Four Axes

Below is a structural reinterpretation of each temperament in DFM terms.

---

# 🩸 **1. Sanguine (Action + Care / Value)**

Sanguine characteristics resemble:
- outward expansion  
- high relational engagement  
- spontaneous action  
- expressive communication  

**Axis activation:**
- Action > Structure  
- Care > Logic  
- Vision mildly activated  
- Innovation lightly engaged  

**Archetypal parallels (temporary modes):**
- Advocate  
- Rebel  
- Creator  
- Driver (light expression)  

**Wave tendencies:**
- fast expansion  
- moderate oscillation  
- lower contraction unless overwhelmed  

---

# 🔥 **2. Choleric (Action + Logic / Structure)**

Choleric characteristics resemble:
- decisiveness  
- assertiveness  
- outcome orientation  
- directive communication  

**Axis activation:**
- Action > Innovation  
- Logic > Value  
- Structure > Care  

**Archetypal parallels:**
- Driver  
- Builder  
- Architect  
- Sage (in long-view strategic mode)  

**Wave tendencies:**
- strong forward momentum  
- risk of contraction when challenged  
- oscillation between Action and Structure poles  

---

# 🌧 **3. Melancholic (Structure + Logic / Reality)**

Melancholic characteristics resemble:
- detail orientation  
- cautiousness  
- reflective analysis  
- emotional depth held internally  

**Axis activation:**
- Structure > Care  
- Logic > Value  
- Reality > Vision  

**Archetypal parallels:**
- Analyst  
- Architect  
- Sage  
- Healer (when emotional depth is expressed constructively)  

**Wave tendencies:**
- slower expansion  
- deeper contraction  
- rumination when Logic–Value tension heightens  

---

# 🌿 **4. Phlegmatic (Care + Reality / Value)**

Phlegmatic characteristics resemble:
- steadiness  
- harmony-seeking  
- adaptability  
- relational stability  

**Axis activation:**
- Care > Structure  
- Value > Logic  
- Reality > Vision  

**Archetypal parallels:**
- Nurturer  
- Healer  
- Advocate  
- Sage (in soft, stabilizing form)  

**Wave tendencies:**
- wide tolerance  
- soft oscillation  
- contraction toward passivity under stress  

---

# 🔄 Temperaments and Wave Dynamics

Temperaments often describe **baseline wave patterns**, not fixed psychological
types.

### **Sanguine**
- broad, energetic expansion  
- flexible shifts between archetypes  
- occasional impulsive contraction  

### **Choleric**
- forceful, linear expansion  
- rigidity under resistance  
- difficulty accessing Value–Care poles under stress  

### **Melancholic**
- slow, deep processing  
- contraction when overloaded  
- expansion through structure, clarity, and meaning  

### **Phlegmatic**
- stable center-of-gravity  
- low reactivity  
- contraction through withdrawal rather than intensity  

In DFM, these patterns reflect **how waves behave**, not who someone is.

# 🧬 How Temperament Relates to Archetype Access

Temperaments loosely describe which archetypes feel more “baseline” for an
individual — not which archetypes they *are*.

Examples:

- A **Sanguine-like** pattern favors Advocate/Rebel/Creator modes  
- A **Choleric-like** pattern favors Driver/Builder/Architect modes  
- A **Melancholic-like** pattern favors Analyst/Sage/Healer modes  
- A **Phlegmatic-like** pattern favors Nurturer/Advocate/Healer modes  

But through development:
- all individuals gain access to more archetypes  
- rigid patterns become flexible  
- axis activation becomes more balanced  
- temperament tendencies soften and integrate

# ⚠️ Ethical Notes

This bridge must not be used to:
- type or categorize individuals  
- label someone’s temperament  
- draw psychological conclusions  
- make behavioural predictions  
- assign identity roles  

Temperaments are interpreted as **dynamic tendencies**, not fixed personalities.

---

# 🧭 Summary

The Temperament Bridge shows how classical temperament patterns can be mapped
onto the Dynamic Field Model:

- Sanguine → Action + Care dynamics  
- Choleric → Action + Logic + Structure dynamics  
- Melancholic → Structure + Logic + Reality dynamics  
- Phlegmatic → Care + Value + Reality dynamics  

These reflect **cognitive-field tendencies**, not personality identities.  
DFM provides a dynamic and integrative lens for understanding how temperament
patterns arise and evolve.
