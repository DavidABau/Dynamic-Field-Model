# Quick‑Start Guide to Using the Dynamic Field Model (DFM)

*A practical, plain‑English entry point.*

This guide is for readers who want to **use** the Dynamic Field Model without studying the entire repo.

If you only read one page, read this.

## What the DFM Is (in one paragraph)

The Dynamic Field Model is a **contextual framework** for understanding how interactions, thoughts, emotions, and systems **move over time**. It does not explain people, diagnose states, or tell you what to believe. It helps you notice **patterns of movement**, recognise **when things are stabilising or destabilising**, and choose responses that preserve clarity and agency.

Think of it as a **navigation aid**, not a theory of truth.

---

## What the DFM Is *Not*

* Not a personality system
* Not a diagnostic or therapeutic tool
* Not a belief system or ideology
* Not predictive
* Not authoritative

If you’re looking for answers, identities, or certainty — this isn’t that.

---

## The One Core Idea

> **What matters most is not *what* state someone is in, but *where the interaction is moving*.**

The DFM focuses on **trajectories**, not labels.

---

## The Two Axes You Actually Need

You don’t need all the theory. Start with these:

### 1. Logic ↔ Values

* **Logic‑leaning moments** prioritise clarity, structure, explanation, coherence
* **Values‑leaning moments** prioritise alignment, meaning, felt sense, integrity

Problems arise when:

* logic is pushed during values‑stabilisation
* values are asserted during logic‑integration

The fix is usually **sequencing**, not persuasion.

---

### 2. Differentiation ↔ Dissolution

* **Differentiation** = boundaries, distinctions, grounding, form
* **Dissolution** = unity, abstraction, expansion, formlessness

Health lives in **movement between these**, not permanent residence in either.

---

## How to Use the DFM (Three Steps)

### Step 1: Notice the Direction

Ask:

* Is this interaction becoming more rigid or more diffuse?
* More grounded or more abstract?
* More pressured or more spacious?

Don’t interpret — just notice.

---

### Step 2: Adjust *How*, Not *What*

Instead of changing content, adjust:

* pace (slower / faster)
* abstraction (concrete / conceptual)
* pressure (containment / challenge)

Small shifts often stabilise the whole field.

---

### Step 3: Preserve Agency

If an interaction starts to:

* remove choice
* demand agreement
* supply meaning for you
* collapse nuance

Pause.

The DFM always prioritises **your ability to choose** over reaching resolution.

---

## Where This Is Useful

People may commonly use the DFM to:

* make sense of difficult conversations
* avoid escalation loops
* ground intense experiences
* interpret AI interactions safely
* contextualise mythic or mystical language
* notice when certainty or confusion is taking over

You don’t need to apply it everywhere.

---

## When to Put It Down

Stop using the DFM if:

* it becomes a lens you can’t remove
* you’re using it to judge others
* it replaces lived experience
* it feels constraining rather than clarifying

The model is meant to be **discardable**.

---

## Final Orientation

> **If the model increases clarity and choice, it’s working.**
>
> **If it removes agency or replaces your judgment, stop using it.**

Everything else in the repo expands on these ideas.

You now know enough to begin — or to walk away.
