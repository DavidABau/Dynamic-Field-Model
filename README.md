# Dynamic Field Model

A multidimensional systems framework for understanding human cognition, motivation, and behaviour.

The Dynamic Field Model (DFM) describes how human experience emerges from the interaction of underlying cognitive fields.  
Rather than viewing personality, intelligence, or behaviour as fixed traits, DFM models them as **dynamic patterns**, shaped by context, development, and internal-external feedback loops.

DFM provides:
- A **4-Axis Cognitive Architecture**
- A **12-Archetype Behavioural Wheel**
- A **Personality Wave Model** (how people shift modes dynamically)
- A **7-Dimensional Model of Intelligence**
- Bridges to existing typologies and psychological frameworks
- Practical applications for communication, development, and decision-making

The goal is a clear, adaptable, non-ideological model that helps individuals and systems understand how cognitive patterns form, evolve, and interact.

## 📚 Core Components

### **1. Four-Axis Cognitive Model**
Human cognition operates along four fundamental axes:
- Logic ↔ Value  
- Vision ↔ Reality  
- Innovation ↔ Action  
- Structure ↔ Care  

These axes form the foundation of the entire Dynamic Field Model.

---

### **2. The Archetype Wheel (12-Phase System)**
A circular model describing 12 archetypal modes of cognition and behaviour.  
Each archetype is a stable configuration arising from the interaction of two axes.  
The wheel highlights strengths, distortions, and natural developmental pathways.

---

### **3. Personality Wave Model**
Personality is not static.  
This model describes how individuals **shift dynamically** between archetypes depending on:
- context  
- stress or coherence  
- developmental stage  
- environmental demands  

The wave model frames personality as an adaptive, oscillating system.

---

### **4. Seven Dimensions of Intelligence**
A holistic model of human intelligence across seven interdependent capacities:
1. Cognitive  
2. Emotional  
3. Somatic  
4. Relational  
5. Ethical  
6. Creative  
7. Integrative  

Each dimension contributes to the overall coherence and adaptability of the individual.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project
The Dynamic Field Model is intended as:
- a **public-facing, open, safe** cognitive framework  
- a **development tool** for individuals  
- a **mapping tool** for systems and AI  
- a **bridge** between psychology, systems theory, and cognitive science  

Its aim is clarity, coherence, and accessibility.

# 📄 Common Misconceptions

The Dynamic Field Model (DFM) is often compared to other systems or traditions
due to superficial similarities in language or structure.  
This section clarifies what DFM is *not*, to prevent confusion or
misinterpretation.

---

## ❌ “Is DFM based on astrology, zodiac signs, or symbolic systems?”

**No.**  
The model’s twelve archetypes arise from the mathematical interaction of four
cognitive axes in a circular topology.  
Many human traditions also use 12-part structures because 12 divides cycles and
circles cleanly.  
The resemblance is coincidental.

DFM contains no symbolic assignments, no planetary associations, and no
esoteric mappings.

---

## ❌ “Is DFM a spiritual or metaphysical system?”

**No.**  
DFM is a structural cognitive model.  
It describes how thinking patterns shift, stabilize, and interact.  
It does not make claims about the nature of consciousness, spiritual states,
or universal metaphysics.

Any deeper philosophical explorations remain outside the scope of the public
framework.

---

## ❌ “Does DFM describe personality types or classify people?”

**No.**  
Unlike typologies (e.g., MBTI, Enneagram, Big Five), DFM does not assign
categories, predict behaviours, or identify identity-based traits.

DFM describes:
- cognitive modes  
- axis activation patterns  
- wave dynamics  
- moment-to-moment shifts  

It is non-diagnostic and non-evaluative.

---

## ❌ “Can DFM be used to diagnose psychological conditions?”

**Absolutely not.**  
DFM is not a clinical tool.  
It does not describe disorders, pathology, symptoms, or mental health
conditions.  
It should never be used as a psychological assessment.

---

## ❌ “Does DFM tell people who they are?”

**No.**  
DFM avoids identity labels entirely.

It supports:
- cognitive clarity  
- flexible self-understanding  
- developmental insight  
- healthier communication  

DFM describes *process*, not *identity*.

---

## ❌ “Is DFM meant to replace other personality systems?”

**No.**  
DFM is complementary, not substitutive.

Typology systems describe long-term tendencies.  
DFM describes real-time cognitive movement.

Both can coexist without conflict.

---

## ❌ “Is there an approved way to read or ‘use’ the archetypes?”

**No.**  
Archetypes in DFM do not assign fixed roles or hidden meanings.  
They describe temporary configurations of cognitive axes.

There is no correct or incorrect archetype to “be.”

---

## ❌ “Does the model imply moral ranking or ‘higher’ vs ‘lower’ states?”

**No.**  
DFM is non-hierarchical.  
All axes and archetypes serve important roles depending on context.

The model avoids:
- value judgments  
- superiority/inferiority narratives  
- prescriptive behaviour standards  

It is descriptive and educational only.

---

## ❌ “Does the model imply the existence of a universal field of consciousness?”

**No.**  
DFM uses the term “field” as a metaphor for the space of cognitive
possibilities.  
It is not a metaphysical claim and does not imply physical or mystical fields.

---

## ❌ “Can this model be used to determine compatibility between people?”

**No.**  
DFM is not a relational typing system and does not produce compatibility
profiles.

It can help people understand *communication patterns*, but not predict
relationships.

---

## Summary

DFM is:
- structural  
- dynamic  
- cognitive  
- non-diagnostic  
- non-symbolic  
- psychologically safe  
- scientifically framed  

Clarifying these misconceptions helps ensure the model is understood and used
as intended.



## ✨ Overview
Human cognition is dynamic.  
This model provides a way to see those dynamics clearly.
