#### The Dynamic Field Model exists to help people understand how humans, systems, technology, and meaning interact in amplified environments — especially in an AI-saturated world. It isn’t a manifesto or a prediction. It’s a grounding tool: a way to see where coherence strengthens or collapses, and how humans can participate more responsibly in complex systems.

# Dynamic Field Model

A multidimensional systems framework for understanding human cognition, motivation, and behaviour.

“This project is not a scientific research programme. It is a contextual framework designed to help people interpret complex experiences, models, and technologies without loss of agency.”

The Dynamic Field Model (DFM) describes how human experience emerges from the interaction of underlying cognitive fields.  
Rather than viewing personality, intelligence, or behaviour as fixed traits, DFM models them as **dynamic patterns**, shaped by context, development, and internal-external feedback loops.

DFM provides:
- A **4-Axis Cognitive Architecture**
- A **12-Archetype Behavioural Wheel**
- A **Personality Wave Model** (how people shift modes dynamically)
- A **7-Dimensional Model of Intelligence**
- Bridges to existing typologies and psychological frameworks
- Practical applications for communication, development, and decision-making

The goal is a clear, adaptable, non-ideological model that helps individuals and systems understand how cognitive patterns form, evolve, and interact.

Linked to this project for an optional understanding of Meaning, Myth, and Metaphysics, see the ajacent project, (MMM) a framework for understanding how meaning systems shape human experience. MMM is not required to read DFM.

## Intent and Use

The Dynamic Field Model (DFM) is provided as a descriptive and navigational framework intended to support clarity, agency, and coherent decision-making. It is designed to help individuals and systems understand patterns of stress, misalignment, and restoration without diagnosing, prescribing, or directing behaviour. DFM is not a clinical tool, an ideological system, or a substitute for professional judgment.

The model may be adapted, referenced, or built upon for educational, reflective, or design purposes, provided it is not presented as authoritative truth, diagnostic instrument, or means of coercion or control. Uses that reduce agency, bypass responsibility, or position the framework as a belief system rather than a navigational aid fall outside its intended purpose.

## Current Status and Intent

This project does not present itself as a rigorously validated psychological model. It is a conceptual architecture — a hypothesis about how cognition may be organised — intended to inspire inquiry and provide a structured lens for thinking about emotional, rational, and perceptual regulation. Its claims should be treated as theoretically interesting rather than empirically confirmed.

This model is offered as a thoughtful theoretical framework rather than a finished scientific claim. It represents an attempt to describe cognition in a structured way that could be explored, tested, challenged, refined, or even partially disproven in the future. Like much of the surrounding work, it exists in the space between lived experience, conceptual clarity, and potential research — not in the space of completed academic proof.

## 📚 Core Components

### **1. Four-Axis Cognitive Model**
Human cognition operates along four fundamental axes:
- Logic ↔ Value  
- Vision ↔ Reality  
- Innovation ↔ Action  
- Structure ↔ Care  

These axes form the foundation of the entire Dynamic Field Model.

---

### **2. The Archetype Wheel (12-Phase System)**
A circular model describing 12 archetypal modes of cognition and behaviour.  
Each archetype is a stable configuration arising from the interaction of two axes.  
The wheel highlights strengths, distortions, and natural developmental pathways.

---

### **3. Personality Wave Model**
Personality is not static.  
This model describes how individuals **shift dynamically** between archetypes depending on:
- context  
- stress or coherence  
- developmental stage  
- environmental demands  

The wave model frames personality as an adaptive, oscillating system.

---

### **4. Seven Dimensions of Intelligence**
A holistic model of human intelligence across seven interdependent capacities:
1. Cognitive  
2. Emotional  
3. Somatic  
4. Relational  
5. Ethical  
6. Creative  
7. Integrative  

Each dimension contributes to the overall coherence and adaptability of the individual.

## Summary

DFM is:
- structural  
- dynamic

- non-diagnostic  
- non-symbolic  
- psychologically safe  
- scientifically framed  

Clarifying these misconceptions helps ensure the model is understood and used
as intended.

## Relationship to Cognitive Field Architecture (CFA)

Dynamic-Field-Model (DFM) describes behavioural and systemic dynamics—how human cognition interacts with environments, systems, and social fields.
It builds on the Cognitive Field Architecture, which describes the internal geometry of awareness itself (perceptual, emotional, rational planes).

CFA → How cognition is structured and moves internally

DFM → How that cognition participates in broader dynamic fields
