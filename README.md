# Dynamic Field Model

A multidimensional systems framework for understanding human cognition, motivation, and behaviour.

The Dynamic Field Model (DFM) describes how human experience emerges from the interaction of underlying cognitive fields.  
Rather than viewing personality, intelligence, or behaviour as fixed traits, DFM models them as **dynamic patterns**, shaped by context, development, and internal-external feedback loops.

DFM provides:
- A **4-Axis Cognitive Architecture**
- A **12-Archetype Behavioural Wheel**
- A **Personality Wave Model** (how people shift modes dynamically)
- A **7-Dimensional Model of Intelligence**
- Bridges to existing typologies and psychological frameworks
- Practical applications for communication, development, and decision-making

The goal is a clear, adaptable, non-ideological model that helps individuals and systems understand how cognitive patterns form, evolve, and interact.

## 📚 Core Components

### **1. Four-Axis Cognitive Model**
Human cognition operates along four fundamental axes:
- Logic ↔ Value  
- Vision ↔ Reality  
- Innovation ↔ Action  
- Structure ↔ Care  

These axes form the foundation of the entire Dynamic Field Model.

---

### **2. The Archetype Wheel (12-Phase System)**
A circular model describing 12 archetypal modes of cognition and behaviour.  
Each archetype is a stable configuration arising from the interaction of two axes.  
The wheel highlights strengths, distortions, and natural developmental pathways.

---

### **3. Personality Wave Model**
Personality is not static.  
This model describes how individuals **shift dynamically** between archetypes depending on:
- context  
- stress or coherence  
- developmental stage  
- environmental demands  

The wave model frames personality as an adaptive, oscillating system.

---

### **4. Seven Dimensions of Intelligence**
A holistic model of human intelligence across seven interdependent capacities:
1. Cognitive  
2. Emotional  
3. Somatic  
4. Relational  
5. Ethical  
6. Creative  
7. Integrative  

Each dimension contributes to the overall coherence and adaptability of the individual.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project
The Dynamic Field Model is intended as:
- a **public-facing, open, safe** cognitive framework  
- a **development tool** for individuals  
- a **mapping tool** for systems and AI  
- a **bridge** between psychology, systems theory, and cognitive science  

Its aim is clarity, coherence, and accessibility.

## Summary

DFM is:
- structural  
- dynamic  
- cognitive  
- non-diagnostic  
- non-symbolic  
- psychologically safe  
- scientifically framed  

Clarifying these misconceptions helps ensure the model is understood and used
as intended.



## ✨ Overview
Human cognition is dynamic.  
This model provides a way to see those dynamics clearly.
