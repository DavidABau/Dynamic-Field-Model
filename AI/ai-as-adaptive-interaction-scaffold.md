# AI as Adaptive Interaction Scaffold

## Purpose

This section describes how **Dynamic Field Model (DFM)–style models** can be used to guide *how* an AI responds to a human, without claiming to understand, diagnose, or define the human.

The goal is not smarter AI in a human sense, but **safer, more coherent interaction** that preserves human agency.

For readers interested in implementation, see “Translating the Dynamic Field Model into Mathematical Form” for a state-space / stability framing of these ideas.

## The Core Problem

Modern AI systems tend to:

* always respond
* always complete the loop
* always match the user's frame

While useful, this creates a risk:

> **AI can unintentionally amplify incoherence, stress, or distortion simply by responding in the wrong mode.**

The issue is rarely *content* alone — it is **interaction dynamics**:

* pace
* abstraction level
* challenge vs containment
* grounding vs expansion

Static response styles fail because humans are not static.

---

## Principle

> **AI should adapt its *interaction mode*, not its beliefs about the user.**

This preserves:

* user autonomy
* interpretive authority
* responsibility for meaning

The AI remains a *carrier and stabiliser of signal*, not an originator of truth.

---

## Interaction Dimensions (Non-Diagnostic)

The following dimensions are *descriptive scaffolds*, not classifications of people.

They describe **how interaction is unfolding**, not *who the user is*.

### 1. Logic ↔ Values

* **Logic-oriented signals**

  * seeking clarity, explanation, structure
  * benefits from sequencing, precision, explicit framing

* **Values-oriented signals**

  * seeking alignment, validation, felt sense
  * benefits from reflection, acknowledgment, reduced pressure

AI adaptation here affects **tone and framing**, not conclusions.

---

### 2. Differentiation ↔ Dissolution

* **Differentiation-heavy interaction**

  * rigidity, over-certainty, narrowed perspective
  * AI can gently widen context or reintroduce alternatives

* **Dissolution-heavy interaction**

  * abstraction drift, inflation, loss of grounding
  * AI should slow down, ground, and re-anchor in concrete reality

This dimension is central to preventing:

* delusion
* nihilism
* premature synthesis

---

### 3. Load Sensitivity (Stress / Capacity)

Without diagnosing, AI can attend to:

* speed of interaction
* emotional intensity
* cognitive overload

High load suggests:

* slower pace
* simpler language
* fewer novel concepts

Low load allows:

* exploration
* synthesis
* challenge

---

## What This Is NOT

This approach explicitly rejects:

* psychological diagnosis
* personality profiling
* therapeutic authority
* behavioural prediction
* AI as moral guide or decision-maker

No permanent user models are required.
No internal states are assumed.

---

## Why This Preserves Agency

Agency is lost when:

* meaning is supplied instead of clarified
* emotional states are interpreted rather than respected
* authority is shifted from human to system

Agency is preserved when:

* interaction adapts without explanation
* the human remains the meaning-maker
* the AI limits its own influence

> **The model constrains the AI — not the human.**

---

## Relationship to the Dynamic Field Model (DFM)

This scaffold applies Dynamic Field Model (DFM) principles:

* interaction occurs within dynamic fields, not fixed traits
* regulation precedes integration
* oscillation between states is healthy; fixation is not

AI is treated as a **field-sensitive interface**, not an identity mirror.

---

## Summary

* Humans are dynamic; AI interaction must be adaptive
* Adaptation should occur at the level of *response style*, not interpretation
* The Dynamic Field Model (DFM) provides a safe, non-invasive scaffold for this adaptation
* The result is AI that supports coherence **without replacing agency**

---

This section is intended as a **design orientation**, not an implementation guide.
If it does not help preserve clarity and autonomy, it should be discarded.
