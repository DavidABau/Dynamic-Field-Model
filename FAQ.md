# Dynamic Field Model — Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ clarifies common questions about the Dynamic Field Model (DFM), its
purpose, what it is, and what it is not.

---

## ❓ Is the Dynamic Field Model a personality typing system?

**No.**  
DFM does not assign personality types, labels, categories, or diagnoses.  
It models **moment-to-moment cognitive dynamics**, not identity structures.

It focuses on:
- how cognition shifts
- how different modes activate
- how waves expand and contract
- how axes interact
- how coherence is supported

It can complement personality systems, but it does not replace or emulate them.

## ❓ Why does the model contain 12 archetypes?

The twelve archetypes arise from the **geometric structure** of the model:

- The Four-Axis Cognitive Model produces eight poles.
- When these poles interact in a circular topology, twelve stable
  configurations emerge.
- These configurations correspond to the twelve archetypes.

This is a mathematical and structural outcome — **not** a symbolic or
mythological one.

Many human systems also use 12-part divisions (e.g., zodiac signs, tribes,
hours, musical notes) because 12 divides a circle cleanly.  
The resemblance is coincidental.

---

## ❓ Is DFM based on astrology, the zodiac, or the twelve tribes?

**No.**  
DFM does not reference, derive from, or align with any symbolic,
numerological, or esoteric systems. Any similarity in the number twelve is a
result of geometric segmentation, not shared conceptual origin.

---

## ❓ Does DFM have any metaphysical or spiritual claims?

**No.**  
DFM is a structural cognitive framework.  
It describes how thinking patterns shift and stabilize.  
It does not make metaphysical claims about consciousness, spirituality, or the
nature of the universe.

Any deeper speculative discussions belong outside the public model.

---

## ❓ Can DFM be used to classify or evaluate people?

**No.**  
DFM is **non-diagnostic** and **non-evaluative**.  
It does not measure ability, assign scores, or categorize individuals.

It offers:
- descriptive clarity  
- developmental insight  
- communication tools  
- cognitive interpretability  

It never assigns identity or predicts behaviour.

---

## ❓ How is DFM different from MBTI, Enneagram, or the Big Five?

DFM describes **states**, not **types**.

- Typologies describe stable traits or identities.
- DFM describes dynamic shifts in cognition.
- Typologies answer: *“Who do you tend to be?”*
- DFM answers: *“How is your cognition operating in this moment?”*

They are complementary but fundamentally different.

---

## ❓ Why use a field model at all?

Because cognition is **dynamic**, not static.  
People shift modes across:
- contexts  
- emotional states  
- tasks  
- stress levels  
- developmental stages  

A field model captures this fluidity far better than category-based systems.

---

## ❓ Can this model be used clinically?

**No.**  
DFM is not a clinical framework.  
It does not provide diagnoses, does not identify disorders, and should not be
used as a psychological test or treatment tool.

It is educational and descriptive only.

---

## ❓ Can researchers or developers use DFM?

Yes — with the following boundaries:

- It can be used as a conceptual scaffold for communication, development,
  interpretability, and AI-human interaction.
- It must **not** be used to create personality classifiers or diagnostic
  algorithms.
- It must be used ethically and transparently.

---

## ❓ Is the model complete?

The public-facing model is stable and coherent.  
Further research, diagrams, and application guides will continue to evolve.

---

## ❓ How should beginners start?

The recommended path:

1. Read the README  
2. Explore the Four Axes  
3. Look at the Archetype Wheel  
4. Learn the Personality Wave Model  
5. Review the Seven Dimensions of Intelligence  
6. Browse the Applications folder  

Everything else builds from these foundations.
